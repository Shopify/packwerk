        Dependency violation: ::SomeName belongs to 'destination_package', but 'source_package' does not specify a dependency on 'destination_package'.
        Are we missing an abstraction?
        Is the code making the reference, and the referenced constant, in the right packages?

        Inference details: this is a reference to ::SomeName which seems to be defined in some/location.rb.
