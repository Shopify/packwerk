# Net::IMAP implements Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) client
# functionality.  The protocol is described in
# [IMAP[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3501]].
#
# == IMAP Overview
#
# An \IMAP client connects to a server, and then authenticates
# itself using either #authenticate or #login.  Having
# authenticated itself, there is a range of commands
# available to it.  Most work with mailboxes, which may be
# arranged in an hierarchical namespace, and each of which
# contains zero or more messages.  How this is implemented on
# the server is implementation-dependent; on a UNIX server, it
# will frequently be implemented as files in mailbox format
# within a hierarchy of directories.
#
# To work on the messages within a mailbox, the client must
# first select that mailbox, using either #select or (for
# read-only access) #examine.  Once the client has successfully
# selected a mailbox, they enter _selected_ state, and that
# mailbox becomes the _current_ mailbox, on which mail-item
# related commands implicitly operate.
#
# Messages have two sorts of identifiers: message sequence
# numbers and UIDs.
#
# Message sequence numbers number messages within a mailbox
# from 1 up to the number of items in the mailbox.  If a new
# message arrives during a session, it receives a sequence
# number equal to the new size of the mailbox.  If messages
# are expunged from the mailbox, remaining messages have their
# sequence numbers "shuffled down" to fill the gaps.
#
# UIDs, on the other hand, are permanently guaranteed not to
# identify another message within the same mailbox, even if
# the existing message is deleted.  UIDs are required to
# be assigned in ascending (but not necessarily sequential)
# order within a mailbox; this means that if a non-IMAP client
# rearranges the order of mailitems within a mailbox, the
# UIDs have to be reassigned.  An \IMAP client thus cannot
# rearrange message orders.
#
# == Examples of Usage
#
# === List sender and subject of all recent messages in the default mailbox
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
#   imap.authenticate('LOGIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
#   imap.examine('INBOX')
#   imap.search(["RECENT"]).each do |message_id|
#     envelope = imap.fetch(message_id, "ENVELOPE")[0].attr["ENVELOPE"]
#     puts "#{envelope.from[0].name}: \t#{envelope.subject}"
#   end
#
# === Move all messages from April 2003 from "Mail/sent-mail" to "Mail/sent-apr03"
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new('mail.example.com')
#   imap.authenticate('LOGIN', 'joe_user', 'joes_password')
#   imap.select('Mail/sent-mail')
#   if not imap.list('Mail/', 'sent-apr03')
#     imap.create('Mail/sent-apr03')
#   end
#   imap.search(["BEFORE", "30-Apr-2003", "SINCE", "1-Apr-2003"]).each do |message_id|
#     imap.copy(message_id, "Mail/sent-apr03")
#     imap.store(message_id, "+FLAGS", [:Deleted])
#   end
#   imap.expunge
#
# == Thread Safety
#
# Net::IMAP supports concurrent threads. For example,
#
#   imap = Net::IMAP.new("imap.foo.net", "imap2")
#   imap.authenticate("cram-md5", "bar", "password")
#   imap.select("inbox")
#   fetch_thread = Thread.start { imap.fetch(1..-1, "UID") }
#   search_result = imap.search(["BODY", "hello"])
#   fetch_result = fetch_thread.value
#   imap.disconnect
#
# This script invokes the FETCH command and the SEARCH command concurrently.
#
# == Errors
#
# An IMAP server can send three different types of responses to indicate
# failure:
#
# NO:: the attempted command could not be successfully completed.  For
#      instance, the username/password used for logging in are incorrect;
#      the selected mailbox does not exist; etc.
#
# BAD:: the request from the client does not follow the server's
#       understanding of the IMAP protocol.  This includes attempting
#       commands from the wrong client state; for instance, attempting
#       to perform a SEARCH command without having SELECTed a current
#       mailbox.  It can also signal an internal server
#       failure (such as a disk crash) has occurred.
#
# BYE:: the server is saying goodbye.  This can be part of a normal
#       logout sequence, and can be used as part of a login sequence
#       to indicate that the server is (for some reason) unwilling
#       to accept your connection.  As a response to any other command,
#       it indicates either that the server is shutting down, or that
#       the server is timing out the client connection due to inactivity.
#
# These three error response are represented by the errors
# Net::IMAP::NoResponseError, Net::IMAP::BadResponseError, and
# Net::IMAP::ByeResponseError, all of which are subclasses of
# Net::IMAP::ResponseError.  Essentially, all methods that involve
# sending a request to the server can generate one of these errors.
# Only the most pertinent instances have been documented below.
#
# Because the IMAP class uses Sockets for communication, its methods
# are also susceptible to the various errors that can occur when
# working with sockets.  These are generally represented as
# Errno errors.  For instance, any method that involves sending a
# request to the server and/or receiving a response from it could
# raise an Errno::EPIPE error if the network connection unexpectedly
# goes down.  See the socket(7), ip(7), tcp(7), socket(2), connect(2),
# and associated man pages.
#
# Finally, a Net::IMAP::DataFormatError is thrown if low-level data
# is found to be in an incorrect format (for instance, when converting
# between UTF-8 and UTF-16), and Net::IMAP::ResponseParseError is
# thrown if a server response is non-parseable.

  # Sends an AUTHENTICATE command to authenticate the client.
  # The +auth_type+ parameter is a string that represents
  # the authentication mechanism to be used. Currently Net::IMAP
  # supports the authentication mechanisms:
  #
  #   LOGIN:: login using cleartext user and password.
  #   CRAM-MD5:: login with cleartext user and encrypted password
  #              (see [RFC-2195] for a full description).  This
  #              mechanism requires that the server have the user's
  #              password stored in clear-text password.
  #
  # For both of these mechanisms, there should be two +args+: username
  # and (cleartext) password.  A server may not support one or the other
  # of these mechanisms; check #capability for a capability of
  # the form "AUTH=LOGIN" or "AUTH=CRAM-MD5".
  #
  # Authentication is done using the appropriate authenticator object:
  # see +add_authenticator+ for more information on plugging in your own
  # authenticator.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #    imap.authenticate('LOGIN', user, password)
  #
  # A Net::IMAP::NoResponseError is raised if authentication fails.
  #
  # source://net-imap-0.2.3/lib/net/imap.rb:403

  # Sends a CAPABILITY command, and returns an array of
  # capabilities that the server supports.  Each capability
  # is a string.  See [IMAP] for a list of possible
  # capabilities.
  #
  # Note that the Net::IMAP class does not modify its

  # Sends a FETCH command to retrieve data associated with a message
  # in the mailbox.
  #
  # The +set+ parameter is a number or a range between two numbers,
  # or an array of those.  The number is a message sequence number,
  # where -1 represents a '*' for use in range notation like 100..-1
  # being interpreted as '100:*'.  Beware that the +exclude_end?+
  # property of a Range object is ignored, and the contents of a
  # range are independent of the order of the range endpoints as per
  # the protocol specification, so 1...5, 5..1 and 5...1 are all
  # equivalent to 1..5.
  #
  # +attr+ is a list of attributes to fetch; see the documentation
  # for Net::IMAP::FetchData for a list of valid attributes.
  #
  # The return value is an array of Net::IMAP::FetchData or nil
  # (instead of an empty array) if there is no matching message.

  # Sends a LIST command, and returns a subset of names from
  # the complete set of all names available to the client.
  # +refname+ provides a context (for instance, a base directory
  # in a directory-based mailbox hierarchy).  +mailbox+ specifies
  # a mailbox or (via wildcards) mailboxes under that context.
  # Two wildcards may be used in +mailbox+: '*', which matches
  # all characters *including* the hierarchy delimiter (for instance,
  # '/' on a UNIX-hosted directory-based mailbox hierarchy); and '%',
  # which matches all characters *except* the hierarchy delimiter.
  #
  # If +refname+ is empty, +mailbox+ is used directly to determine
  # which mailboxes to match.  If +mailbox+ is empty, the root
  # name of +refname+ and the hierarchy delimiter are returned.
  #
  # The return value is an array of +Net::IMAP::MailboxList+. For example:
  #
  #   imap.create("foo/bar")
  #   imap.create("foo/baz")
  #   p imap.list("", "foo/%")

  # Sends a NAMESPACE command and returns the namespaces that are available.
  # The NAMESPACE command allows a client to discover the prefixes of
  # namespaces used by a server for personal mailboxes, other users'
  # mailboxes, and shared mailboxes.
  #
  # The NAMESPACE extension predates [IMAP4rev1[https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2501]],
  # so most IMAP servers support it. Many popular IMAP servers are configured
  # with the default personal namespaces as `("" "/")`: no prefix and "/"
  # hierarchy delimiter. In that common case, the naive client may not have
  # any trouble naming mailboxes.
  #
  # But many servers are configured with the default personal namespace as
  # e.g. `("INBOX." ".")`, placing all personal folders under INBOX, with "."
  # as the hierarchy delimiter. If the client does not check for this, but
  # naively assumes it can use the same folder names for all servers, then
  # folder creation (and listing, moving, etc) can lead to errors.
  #
  # From RFC2342:
  #
  #    Although typically a server will support only a single Personal
  #    Namespace, and a single Other User's Namespace, circumstances exist
  #    where there MAY be multiples of these, and a client MUST be prepared
  #    for them. If a client is configured such that it is required to create
  #    a certain mailbox, there can be circumstances where it is unclear which
  #    Personal Namespaces it should create the mailbox in. In these
  #    situations a client SHOULD let the user select which namespaces to
  #    create the mailbox in.
  #
  # The user of this method should first check if the server supports the
  # NAMESPACE capability.  The return value is a +Net::IMAP::Namespaces+
  # object which has +personal+, +other+, and +shared+ fields, each an array
  # of +Net::IMAP::Namespace+ objects. These arrays will be empty when the
  # server responds with nil.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #    capabilities = imap.capability
  #    if capabilities.include?("NAMESPACE")
  #      namespaces = imap.namespace
  #      if namespace = namespaces.personal.first
  #        prefix = namespace.prefix  # e.g. "" or "INBOX."
  #        delim  = namespace.delim   # e.g. "/" or "."
  #        # personal folders should use the prefix and delimiter
  #        imap.create(prefix + "foo")
  #        imap.create(prefix + "bar")
  #        imap.create(prefix + %w[path to my folder].join(delim))

  # see [IMAP] section 6.4.4 for a full list.
  #
  # <message set>:: a set of message sequence numbers.  ',' indicates
  #                 an interval, ':' indicates a range.  For instance,
  #                 '2,10:12,15' means "2,10,11,12,15".
  #
  # BEFORE <date>:: messages with an internal date strictly before
  #                 <date>.  The date argument has a format similar
  #                 to 8-Aug-2002.
  #
  # BODY <string>:: messages that contain <string> within their body.
  #
  # CC <string>:: messages containing <string> in their CC field.
  #
  # FROM <string>:: messages that contain <string> in their FROM field.
  #
  # NEW:: messages with the \Recent, but not the \Seen, flag set.

  # SINCE <date>:: messages with an internal date on or after <date>.
  #
  # SUBJECT <string>:: messages with <string> in their subject.
  #
  # TO <string>:: messages with <string> in their TO field.
  #
  # For example:
  #
  #   p imap.search(["SUBJECT", "hello", "NOT", "NEW"])
