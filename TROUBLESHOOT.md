## Troubleshooting violations

### Feedback loop
Packwerk can give feedback via continuous integration (CI) if you have it set up, but that is a long feedback cycle. If you want faster feedback, use Packwerk on the command line locally.

You can specify folders or packages in Packwerk commands for a shorter run time:

     bundle exec packwerk check components/your_package

     bundle exec packwerk update components/your_package

_Note: You cannot specify folders or packages for `packwerk validate` because the command runs for the entire application._

### Package Privacy violation
A constant that is private to its package has been referenced from outside of the package. Constants are declared private in their package’s `package.yml`.

See: [USAGE.md - Enforcing privacy boundary](USAGE.md#Enforcing-privacy-boundary)

#### Interpreting Privacy violation

> /Users/JaneDoe/src/github.com/sample-project/user/app/controllers/labels_controller.rb:170:30
> Privacy violation: '::Billing::CarrierInvoiceTransaction' is private to 'billing' but referenced from 'user'.
> Is there a public entrypoint in 'billing/app/public/' that you can use instead?
>
> Inference details: 'Billing::CarrierInvoiceTransaction' refers to ::Billing::CarrierInvoiceTransaction which seems to be defined in billing/app/models/billing/carrier_invoice_transaction.rb.

There has been a privacy violation of the package `billing` in the package `user`, through the use of the constant `Billing::CarrierInvoiceTransaction` in the file `user/app/controllers/labels_controller.rb`.

##### Suggestions
You may be accessing the implementation of a piece of functionality that is supposed to be accessed through a public interface on the package. Try to use the public interface instead. A package’s public interface should be defined in its `app/public` folder and documented.

The functionality you’re looking for may not be intended to be reused across packages at all. If there is no public interface for it but you have a good reason to use it from outside of its package, find the people responsible for the package and discuss a solution with them.

### Package Dependency violation
A constant defined in a package A is referenced from a package B that doesn’t define a dependency on A. Packages define their dependencies in their `package.yml`.

See: [USAGE.md - Enforcing dependency boundary](USAGE.md#Enforcing-dependency-boundary)

#### Interpreting Dependency violation

> /Users/JaneDoe/src/github.com/sample-project/billing/app/jobs/document_processing_job.rb:48:6
> Dependency violation: ::Edi::Source belongs to 'edi', but 'billing' does not specify a dependency on 'edi'.
> Are we missing an abstraction?
> Is the code making the reference, and the referenced constant, in the right packages?
>
> Inference details: 'Edi::Source' refers to ::Edi::Source which seems to be defined in edi/app/models/edi/source.rb.

There has been a dependency violation in the package `billing` to the package `edi`, through the use of the constant `Edi::Source` in the file `billing/app/jobs/document_processing_job.rb`.

##### Suggestions
If a package declares dependencies, assume that some thought went into that. It is unlikely that the correct fix is to add another dependency.
Check if the code containing the reference and the code defining the constants are in the right packages. If not, fix that by moving code around.

If a dependency A -> B is not desired, but a dependency B -> A is OK, consider using [dependency inversion](https://www.sandimetz.com/blog/2009/03/21/solid-design-principles).

If you’re getting stuck, find people with context about the two packages involved and ask for their opinion.
