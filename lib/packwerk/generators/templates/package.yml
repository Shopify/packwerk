# Turn on privacy checks for this package
# enforcing privacy is often not useful for the root package, because it would require defining a public interface
# for something that should only be a thin wrapper in the first place.
# We recommend enabling this for any new packages you create to aid with encapsulation.

# By default the public path will be app/public/, however this may not suit all applications' architecture so
# this allows you to modify what your package's public path is.
